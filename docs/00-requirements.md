## 1. Project Overview
The "My Daniel" system is a centralized management platform for the Daniel Rowing Centre. It consolidates organizational data into a single system to efficiently manage customers, employees, equipment, payments, and water activities. 

The system replaces manual spreadsheets and fragmented applications, providing:
*   Real-time data synchronization.
*   Digital registration processes.
*   Automated payroll tracking and reporting.

## 3. Functional Requirements — User Stories

Each user story is labeled with its implementation status:

*   ✅ **Implemented** — fully built in the current version
*   🚧 **Partially Implemented** — data/structure exists but no complete UI
*   🔮 **Future** — planned for a future version, not yet implemented

*(Note: As this is the initial design baseline for the new system, all features are currently marked as Future).*
